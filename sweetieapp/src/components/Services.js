            <h1 className="display-4">Consult an Online Doctor 24/7</h1>
            <p className="text-justify">An Online Doctor is a physician who
              consults with patients via telephone or video,
              eliminating the need to visit a physical doctor’s
              office. While these doctors cannot treat all medical conditions,
              online doctors have the ability to treat a wide variety
              of ailments, and in many cases, can prescribe medication
              for patients to pick up at their local pharmacy.
              Our online doctor service uses innovations
              in telemedicine to allow our physicians to
              treat patients over the Internet via phone or video.
              The WebDoctors team of physicians eliminates travel
              and the waiting room. See one of our board-certified
              online doctors virtually and get treated in minutes
              with our telehealth program. There are over fifty
              commonly occurring issues and conditions that can
              be diagnosed and treated remotely through virtual
              doctor visits. Seeing an doctor online is now possible
              any time of the day or night. Consult with a general
              practitioner from your phone, tablet, or computer and
              skip the waiting room completely. We’ll send your medication
              prescription directly to your local pharmacy,
              ready for pick up.
